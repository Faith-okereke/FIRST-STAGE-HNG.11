        <h3>My goals for this year and the next...</h3>
        <p>
          This year is halfway through already which means we've come far and we
          are hoping for a better year before it runs out. I have lived through
          the year justv like everyone else reading this. The same way you have
          pans for the remaining half is the same way I do too.
        </p>

          This single webpage shows the things I intend to achieve in my
          software engineering career to take me to the peak of it.
